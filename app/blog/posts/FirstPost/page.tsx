        If you're reading this in the source code, you might be wondering:
        what's going on here? Well, let me explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of using a traditional backend to manage my content and display
        it in predefined ways, I've opted for a completely custom approach.
        Essentially, if it can be written in TypeScript, it can be showcased
        here on this blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, there are more elegant solutions that generate pages dynamically
        at runtime and store content in databases. However, I prefer simplicity.
        I'd rather spend my time writing code than endlessly customizing
        datasets and logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's the twist: rather than constantly updating posts with the latest
        developments in my journey, they remain static. This way, they capture
        the essence of my journey at different points in time, rather than just
        the end result.
      </p>
      <p>
        My belief is that by keeping posts static, I can use them as snapshots
        to illustrate code examples and explain methodologies. This allows for
        reflection on past code and hopefully inspires improvements in future
        code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some may argue for dynamically generated content from a database, but
        why complicate things? CPU cycles may be cheap, but when compared to the
        cost of storage CPU suddenly looks expensive. Static pages are perfect
        for content that rarely changes. Of course, there will still be dynamic
        elements on the site, but the point is to maintain control over
        everything from the source code.
      </p>
      <p>
        By keeping each post independent, I can easily reuse and update them as
        needed. This approach allows for flexibility and scalability without the
        overhead of complex backend systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        While my rationale may evolve over time, my intention is to continue
        storing content in this manner and perhaps enhance it as technologies
        progress. With the power of code, I can create a "static" HTML
        website/blog in a "modern" way, showcasing complex tasks and code while
        preserving its history.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, stay tuned for more updates. While they may not come daily or
        weekly, there will be plenty to share in the years to come.
